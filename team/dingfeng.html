<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: added <strong>the ability to automatically schedule and answer flashcard</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: correctly approximate the forgetting curve to remind user when is the best time to study</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature is core to flashcard memorisation technique. Spaced repetition for better memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future.
It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: added a simple Tag functionality that was eventually changed into CardTag Association.</p>

<p>Flashy is an application to help users organise their flashcards to help them memorise better.
Physical flashcards are bulky and hard to search for. They are also difficult to organise. Flashy is the result of our desire to eliminate these challenges that arise from the use of conventional flashcards.
Flashy helps you organise your flashcards with a powerful <strong>tagging</strong> system. Flashy is able to retrieve all flashcards of a given tag in a flash.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As students, we understand that planning out studying sessions is hard. Therefore, we have also built into Flashy an intelligent scheduler, so you can focus on studying, instead of planning your study sessions. Our scheduler uses
<strong>spaced repetition</strong>, which has been shown to be effective for studying.</p>

<code>Spaced Repetition</code> embodies the idea behind the phrase "don&#8217;t burn the midnight oil". Spreading out study sessions is
shown to be more effective than cramming multiple sessions in a single night.

<p>Although Flashy was built for the language learner in mind, it should prove useful for any student, as new studying tool in their arsenal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Flashy is <strong>optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface</strong> (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Fast typists will find that Flashy can get their flashcard management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.</p>

<p>The core component of how spaced repetition works is that it keep tracks of how
good the user is with a certain card. Our scheduling algorithm is an implementation
of the well known SM2 algorithm used by Supermemo, another flashcard app.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main idea of how this is done is to keep a score of how good a user is with a certain card, a <code>Schedule</code> class is created.
Each card has its own <code>Schedule</code> object. There are some functions to allow the user to update
the score of the card after each time the user has answered it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many possible ways how this could have been implemented.

<p>The <code>feedbackRouterHandler(int confidenceLevel)</code> function is the main part making the whole Scheduler system work.

<p><code>lowerBoundRememberRate</code> default = 0.85. The percent of information we want users to retain.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><code>lastInterval</code> default = 1. The last interval given to schedule a review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>easingFactor</code> default = 1.3. How easy is it for the user to remember a fact,
the larger this number the easier it is.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is a simple summary of what is happening internally.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>\(newEasingFactor = historicalEasingFactor * \frac{\log{(lowerBoundRememberRate)}}{\log{(successRate)}}\)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Initially when the user first creates a card, we give then a grace period with <code>learningPhase</code>. During this period we do not want to penalise the user for mistakes as this is a grace period for the user to pick up new cards. Penalising would be irritating and might demotivate learning.
Any feedback within this period will not update the <code>easingFactor</code>, feedback will only update after the learning phase.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>newEasingFactor</code> is dependent on \(\log{(successRate)}\).
Suppose we want the user to retain 85% of the information learnt.
We set the <code>lowerBoundRememberRate</code> to 0.85.
If <code>successRate</code> &lt; <code>lowerBoundRememberRate</code> newEasingFactor will reduce and card will be scheduled more frequently.
If the interval is too long, users might forget cards. Thus lowering the <code>easingFactor</code> and <code>intervals</code> will reduce.</p>

<p>We presume that users would often want to review lists of flashcards, thus these are very frequently typed.
It would be very irritating if users had to constantly key in showdue d/14 m/4 y/2018 when its obviously just today&#8217;s date.
Thus we designed these commands to be more intelligence and less strict about its input parameters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whichever field <code>d/ m/ y/</code> are not present, it will be assumed to be today&#8217;s day, month or year.
So doing <code>showdue</code> without any parameters will just return cards due by today.</p>

Initially any typos or errors made would just assume users would like to get cards due by today.
However some users find this flexibility to be a bug, now we strictly enforce that <code>showdue</code> must be empty to return today&#8217;s cards.

Although only <code>showdue</code> is talked about. This is actually a generic date parser. <code>schedule</code> command uses the same thing.
