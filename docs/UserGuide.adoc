== Introduction

Flashy is a desktop app for managing flashcards. It is built with the language learner in mind, but should be helpful for any student. Flashy is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Fast typists will find that Flashy can get their flashcard management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+

.  Here are some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all tags and cards
* **`addc`**`f/Front b/Back t/tag1 t/tag2` : adds a flashcard with front as `Front` and back as `Back`, tagged with `tag1` and `tag2`.
* **`deletec`**`3` : deletes the 3rd flashcard in the visible list
* *`exit` or `quit`* : exits the application

Typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window. Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Terminology]]
== Terminology
In Flashy, flashcards are organised with tags. Tags are used to filter down the card list to a relevant subject. For example, a student studying multiple subjects can create tags for each subject.

Cards can have multiple tags.

== Features

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user.

[NOTE.example]
====
In `addc f/FRONT`, `FRONT` is a parameter which can be used as `addc f/ What's the best flash card application? b/Flashy`.
====

* Items in square brackets are optional.

[NOTE.example]
====
`f/FRONT b/BACK [t/TAG]` can be used as `f/Am I awesome? b/Yes! t/selfhelp` or as `f/Am I awesome? /Yes!`.
====

* Items with `â€¦` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.

[NOTE.example]
====
`[t/TAG]` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/biology`, `t/biology t/midterms2018`.
====

* Parameters can be specified be in any order.

[NOTE.example]
====
If the command specifies `f/FRONT, b/BACK`, `b/BACK f/FRONT` is also acceptable.

To access this help guide at any time, type `help` into the command box and press kbd:[Enter].

=== Managing Cards
=== Adding a flashcard: `addc`

Adds a flashcard to Flashy. The presence of `o/OPTION` parameters will determine whether it is a normal or MCQ-type flashcard. +
Format: `addc f/FRONT b/BACK t/TAG` or +
`addc f/FRONT o/OPTION o/OPTION .. b/BACK t/TAG`

Examples:

* `addc f/What is the greatest flashcard application? b/Flashy t/Trivia` +
Adds a normal flashcard with the front and back of the first card being `What is the greatest flashcard application?` and `Flashy` respectively, as well as tagging it as `Trivia`.
* `addc f/Which continent is Singapore in? o/Asia o/Africa o/Australia o/South America b/1` +
Adds a MCQ-type flashcard with the front being `Which continent is Singapore in?`, options includes `Asia`, `Africa`, `Australia` and `South America` and back being `1`.

[TIP]
A flashcard can have any number of tags (including 0).
[CAUTION]
Ensure that the parameter for `b/` falls between 1 the number of options inclusive.

==== Editing a normal flashcard : `editc`

Edits an existing flashcard currently stored in Flashy. +
Format: `editc INDEX [f/FRONT] [b/BACK]`

****
* Edits the normal flashcard at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the last card listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* This only applies to parameters which you have supplied. If, for example, no parameters for `f/` are supplied, the front of the card would not be edited.
****

Examples:

* `editc 1 f/What is the greatest flashcard application? b/Flashy` +
Edits the front and back of the 1st flashcard to be `What is the greatest flashcard application?` and `Flashy` respectively.
* `editc 2 b/Lee Hsien Loong` +
Edits the back of the 2nd flashcard to be `Lee Hsien Loong`.

[CAUTION]
Do ensure that the flashcard at the specified index is a normal card, or else an error would occur.

==== Editing a MCQ-type flashcard : `editm`

Edits an existing MCQ-type flashcard currently stored in Flashy. +
Format: `editm INDEX [f/FRONT] [o/OPTION_NUMBER/OPTION] [o/OPTION_NUMBER/OPTION] ... [b/BACK]`

****
* Edits the MCQ-type flashcard at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the last card listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* This only applies to parameters which you have supplied. If, for example, no parameters for `f/` are supplied, the front of the card would not be edited.
****

Examples:

* `editm 1 f/When is National Day in Singapore? o/2/9th July o/3/10th July` +
Edits the front of the 1st flashcard to be `How many legs does an insect have?` as well as edits option number 2 and 3 to be `9th July` and `10th July`  respectively.
* `editc 2 b/Lee Hsien Loong` +
Edits the back of the 2nd flashcard to be `Lee Hsien Loong`.

[CAUTION ]
Do ensure that the flashcard at the specified index is a MCQ-type card, or else an error would occur.

==== Deleting a flashcard : `deletec`

Deletes the specified flashcard. +
Format: `deletec INDEX`

****
* Deletes the card at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Examples:

`deletec 2` +
Deletes the 2nd flashcard in the list.

=== Using flashcard
After adding and managing your flashcards, its time to get your A+!
This section will teach you how to let Flashy's intelligent scheduling algorithm prompt you the best time to study!

==== Showing a flashcard : `show`

Reveals the answer of the flashcard identified by the index number used in the list. +
Format: `show INDEX`

****
* The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.
* The index *must be a positive integer* `1, 2, 3, ...`
****

Examples:

* `show 2` +
Shows the 2nd flashcard in the list.
* `show 1` +
Shows the 1st flashcard in the list.

==== Answering flashcards: `Schedule`
Answer to give feedback to the scheduling algorithm to schedule the cards for future review.

Format: `schedule CONFIDENCE`

****
* The confidence can only be 0, 1, 2.
* `show` cammand must be used first before `schedule` can be used.
****

There are 3 `CONFIDENCE` levels

* `answer 0` +
Go again. I don't know the answer to this card. Card will then be requeued into the same session again.
* `answer 1` +
Pass. I kind of know the answer, but need more practice. Card will then be scheduled for the near future. To get more practice.
* `answer 2` +
Easy A+. Card will then be scheduled further into the future. Other cards need more review than this one.

[TIP]
====
This gives feedback to the scheduler algorithm to automatically schedule the card for review at a time when it thinks you are likely to forget it.

This design is based off the well known forgetting curve, you can read more about it here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve
====

Examples:

* `schedule 1` +
Card will be resheduled into near future.

==== Show flashcards for review: `Today`
Lists and show flashcards due for review today.

Format: `Today`

Example:

* `Today`

Lists and show flashcards due for review today.

=== Managing Tags
==== Selecting a tag : `select`

Selects the tag identified by the index number. This will show only flashcards with the tag selected. +
Format: `select INDEX`

****
* The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.
* The index *must be a positive integer* `1, 2, 3, ...`
****

Examples:

* `select 2` +
Selects the 2nd tag in the list.
* `select 1` +
Selects the 1st tag in the list.

==== Filtering tags: `find`

Filters the tag list to contain those that match the search terms. +
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

[TIP]
====
The search is case-insensitive, and finds exact partial matches to the tag name. For example, `bio` would match `Biology`.
====

Examples:

* `find biology` will show only tags matching the word `biology`. This will match `Biology`, `biology`, and `Biology Midterms`, and not `bio`, or `chemistry`.

==== Editing a tag : `edit`

Updates an existing tag to the specified values. +
Format: `edit INDEX t/TAG c/COLOR`

****
* Edits the tag at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the current tag listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* Color must be a string of length 6 specifying a link:https://htmlcolorcodes.com/[hex color code]. For example, the color white is represented as `FFFFFF`.
* The existing name of the tag will be replaced with the value that was entered.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 t/French` +
Changes the name of the first tag in the list to `French`.
* `edit 2 t/German c/FF5733` +
Changes the name of the second tag in the list to `German` and the color of the tag to a shade of orange.

==== Deleting a Tag: `delete`

Deletes an existing tag. This will remove the tag from all cards that have the tag.

Examples:

* `delete 1` deletes the first visible tag.
* `delete 2` deletes the second visible tag.

=== Clearing all data : `clear`

Instructs Flashy to clear all data. +
Format: `clear`

[TIP]
This command will instruct Flashy to delete all tags and flashcards. Use this command with caution.

=== Listing entered commands : `history`

Lists all the commands that you have entered in reverse chronological order. +
Format: `history`

[NOTE]
====
Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows will display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.
====

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo and Redo
Some commands support undoing and redoing. The commands are `add`, `addc`, `addm`, `edit`, `editc`, `editm`, `delete`, `deletec`, and `clear`.


==== Undoing previous command : `undo`

Restores the address book to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed. +
Format: `undo`
